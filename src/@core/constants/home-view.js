While songs can make us collectively blurt out lyrics in unison, they can also be incredibly nostalgic for everyone. Move over setting up games from scratch when hosting a party. Just download the GrooveGuess app and create an atmosphere that vibes with the occasion. You can play a game of guessing the artist, year, album, or song. It does not matter if you are a noob or a pro. The songs will have you taking a trip down memory lane, singing along, and competing with the others to show off your musical and pop culture knowledge.',
